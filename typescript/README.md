Trivia kata in typescript
=========================

To run the game with random dice rolls
``` sh
make run
```
or
``` sh
npm run start
```

To run the tests
``` sh
make test
```
This will create the Golden Master if it doesn't already exist;
otherwise it will run the game 1,000 times and compare the outputs
with the existing Golden Master.
